# Single image that serves every network transport of the `useragent` VGI worker:
#   docker run ... IMG            -> HTTP server on $PORT      (default; Fly.io / local)
#   docker run ... IMG tcp        -> raw Arrow-IPC over TCP on $PORT_TCP
#   docker run -i ... IMG stdio   -> stdio worker DuckDB spawns on-host
# See docker-entrypoint.sh.
#
# Like vgi-units this worker is STATELESS: the uap-core regex database is embedded
# into the binary via include_bytes!, so there is no /data volume, no model
# registry, and no `farm.query.vgi.volumes` mount-discovery label. The image is
# just the binary + a tiny entrypoint.
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ---- build stage -----------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned glibc (bookworm) so the binary links against the same libc the slim
# runtime ships. Pure-Rust dependency tree (uaparser is regex-only, no native
# deps), so the base rust image needs no extra system packages.

# Copy the whole workspace (manifests + sources + lockfile). The cargo registry
# and target dir are BuildKit cache mounts, so the binary is copied OUT to a
# non-cache path before the layer ends (cache mounts don't persist in the image).
